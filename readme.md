Between - Easy Tweening Library for Unity
============================

Between is a fork of [Betwixt](https://github.com/Jewelots/Betwixt), a simple library to ease and tween between any generic types, and provides a robust fast API to allow you to do
whatever you set out to do, in the easiest way possible.

The original source was adapted to add some helper function in order to be used in [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com)
